# Driving-Dangerously
A data-driven analysis of road accidents 

> :warning: **This project is still under development**: Some features may not work as expected!


Road accidents are a major cause of concern in India, as they result in loss of lives, injuries and economic losses. According to the annual report ‘Road accidents in India — 2021’ published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, India witnessed 4.37 lakh road accidents in 2021, which claimed 1.35 lakh lives and injured 4.39 lakh people. The report also reveals that over-speeding was the most common cause of road accidents, accounting for 67.3% of the total accidents and 72.6% of the fatalities. The report also highlights the state-wise and city-wise trends of road accidents, as well as the measures taken by the government to improve road safety. Some of the initiatives include implementing the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act 2019, launching the National Road Safety Month, conducting road safety audits and awareness campaigns, and promoting the use of helmets and seat belts.



This repository contains the code and data for a data analysis project on driving dangerously. The main goal of this project is to explore the factors and consequences of road accidents and death in different countries and regions.

The data sources used for this project are:


The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, India.
~The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, which provides data on road traffic deaths, injuries, and risk factors for 175 countries.
~The World Bank Open Data, which provides data on various indicators of economic and social development for 264 countries and regions.


The code files are:

data_preprocessing.ipynb, which performs data cleaning, merging, and wrangling on the raw data files.
data_analysis.ipynb, which performs exploratory data analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing on the processed data.
data_modeling.ipynb, which builds and evaluates predictive models for road traffic deaths using machine learning techniques.
The main findings of this project are:

Road traffic deaths are a major public health problem, causing 1.35 million deaths globally in 2016, with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 93% of the fatalities.
The main risk factors for road traffic deaths are speed, alcohol, seat-belt use, helmet use, and mobile phone use while driving.
The main predictors for road traffic deaths are income level, road infrastructure quality, vehicle fleet composition, and road user behavior.
The best performing model for predicting road traffic deaths is a random forest classifier, which achieves an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1-score of 0.85 on the test set.



The limitations and future directions of this project are:

The data sources have some limitations in terms of completeness, consistency, and comparability across countries and regions.
The data analysis and modeling could be improved by incorporating more variables, such as weather conditions, road design, and driver education.
The data analysis and modeling could be extended to other outcomes of interest, such as road traffic injuries, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and economic costs.
